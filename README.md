SDL Platformer
--------------

The simple platformer written in C and using SDL. As a C++ programmer, I wanted 
to experiment with pure C and graphics, and a game was perfect for that. But it 
turned out that I had no good idea for the game itself, so this is a working 
model rather than a complete game.

Compiled with mingw 4.9.1 (C99 dialect), requires SDL 2.0 and SDL_ttf 2.0.
